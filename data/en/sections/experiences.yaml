    # company overview
    overview: I worked in the Data Analytics division of this major semiconductor company for about 3 years, after first doing an internship with them.
  positions:
  - designation: Data Scientist
    start: Mar 2021
    end: Jun 2022
    responsibilities:
    - As a Data Scientist, I spearheaded the development of end-to-end data analytical solutions for the customer operations team, efficiently handling 2 billion rows of weekly data. 
    - I demonstrated my capabilities by delivering a successful Proof of Concept (PoC) where I developed a scalable Spark Streaming/Kafka framework to process real-time data from 15 industrial pump signals. Through the implementation of an LSTM neural network model, I efficiently detected factory production line failures, potentially resulting in significant cost savings of $xM annually by minimizing downtime, scrap, and repair expenses.
    - This involved data cleansing, provisioning, curation, and visualization, enabling the monitoring of demand-billing signals and optimizing the supply chain. 
    - Additionally, I collaborated with stakeholders from various business domains such as pricing, customer operations, supply chain, sales, manufacturing, and online business.

    - My responsibilities encompassed creating PL/SQL scripts, Spark, and Kafka scripts, while building data visualizations and BI reports in SAP BusinessObjects, Tableau, and Spotfire that were user-friendly and provided valuable insights into complex data. 
    - Throughout my tenure, I collaborated closely with stakeholders from diverse business domains, including pricing, customer operations, supply chain, sales, manufacturing, and online business.
